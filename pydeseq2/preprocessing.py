    """
    Return normalized counts and size_factors.

    Uses the median of ratios method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    counts : pandas.DataFrame or ndarray
        Raw counts. One column per gene, one row per sample.
    conditions : pandas.DataFrame or ndarray
        Raw counts. One column per gene, one row per sample.
    norm_methods : str
        Methods of normalization to apply to the counts matrix.
        Can either be RLE (default) or MRN, which represent
        "Relative Log Expression" or "Median Ratio Normalization".
        Please see "In Papyro Comparison of TMM (edgeR), RLE (DESeq2),

        (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2016.00164/full#B1)
        for more information about MRN.

    Returns
    -------
    deseq2_counts : pandas.DataFrame or ndarray
        DESeq2 normalized counts.
        One column per gene, rows are indexed by sample barcodes.

    size_factors : pandas.DataFrame or ndarray
        DESeq2 normalization factors.

    This normalization method stands for Median Ratio Normalization and is
